ASxxxx and ASlink V3.11 January 2002

    ASxxxx Cross Assemblers, Version 3.11, January 2002. The  ASxxxx
assemblers are a series of microprocessor assemblers written in the
C programming language.  This  collection contains cross assemblers
for the 6800(6802/6808), 6801(hd6303), 6804,  6805,  68HC08,  6809,
68HC11, 68HC12, 68HC16, 8051, 8085(8080), z80(hd64180), GameBoy(z80),
H8/3xx, DS8xCxxx and 6500 series microprocessors.  The companion
program ASLINK is a relocating linker supporting all the cross
assemblers.  The  assemblers  and  linker  have  been  tested using
Linux, DJGPP, Cygwin-1.3.x, Sun Solaris (GCC), Symantec C/C++
V6.1/V7.2,  and VC6 with MS-DOS/Windows 3.x/9x/NT/2000/XP.
Complete source code  and  documentation  for  the  assemblers
and linker  is  included  with the distribution.  Additionally,
test code for each assembler and several  microprocessor  monitors
(ASSIST05  for  the  6805,  MONDEB and ASSIST09 for the 6809, and
BUFFALO 2.5 for the 6811) are included as  working  examples  of
use of these assemblers.
