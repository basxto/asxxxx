[Ported ASXXXX to Solaris host.]

The Solaris makefile assumes gcc (not the optional language package cc
supplied by Sun at additional cost and which I do not have). The other
files should hopefully be obvious.

Here is my system info:

	$ uname -a
	SunOS sun1307 5.5.1 Generic_103640-34 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
	$ 

That means:
	Operating system:        SunOS
	Version:                 Generic_103640-34
	Release Level:           5.5.1
	Machine Hardware Class:  sun4u
	ISA/Processor Type:      sparc
        Hardware Implementation: SUNW,Ultra-5_10
	Node Name:               sun1307

I also did a make on the test suite, which gave a successful conclusion.
