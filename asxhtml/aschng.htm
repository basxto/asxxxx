   Summary  of  changes/additions to the ASxxxx Assemblers from
Version 4.10 to Version 4.11.  

     1.  Corrected coding errors that affected  BANKS
         containing multiple ABS areas or mixed AREA types. 

     2.  Corrected improper use of R_USGN in most  addressing
         modes  in AS6500.  This caused unexpected 'a'
         errors in V4.xx  because  of  the  ASxxxx  core
         change to 32-bit integers and arithmetic.  

     3.  Corrected errors in the .local and .globl assembler
         directive  processing  routine that introduced
         unwanted side effects for variable and symbol
         definition  files.  These effects included improper
         definitions and incorrect error warnings.  

     4.  The  following  new  subdirectories and their files
         have been added to the asxtst directory:  

          *  areabank     Area and Bank Processing Test 
             This  directory contains several test programs:
             ts.asm (single file - multiple areas),  tm1.asm
             and  tm2.asm  (multiple file - multiple areas),
             and tbm.asm, tbm1.asm, and tbm2.asm (  multiple
             file  -  multiple  areas  within  a  bank)  and
             several other files which  verify  the  correct
             operation of the linker when used with a single
             linked file, multiple linked  files  having  no
             banking,  and  multiple linked files with bank-
             ing.  These reference files show in detail  how
             the .area and .bank directives work together.  

          *  equtst       Equate Processing Test 
             This directory contains a test file for verify-
             ing the operation of the .globl, .local,  .equ,
             .gblequ,  and .lclequ directives and the =, ==,
             and =:  equalities.  

          *  inctst       Nested Include File Test 

          *  itst         Include File Error Reporting Test 


     5.  Added 10 undocumented  8085  instructions  to  the
         AS8085 assembler.  


   Summary  of  changes/additions  to the ASxxxx Assemblers from
Version 4.00 to Version 4.10.  

     1.  Added new assemblers for the Zilog EZ80, Zilog Z8, Sig-
         netics 2650, and Fujitsu F2MC8(L,FX) processors.  

     2.  Added the processor cycle count option (-c) to all pro-
         cessors.  

     3.  Several   of  the  assemblers  (ASZ80,  ASRAB,  AS6805,
         AS6808, AS6812, ASF2MC8, ...) now  support  subsets  or
         supersets  of  their basic opcodes by the use of assem-
         bler specific directives.  

     4.  Added .ifeq, .ifne, .iflt, .ifgt, .ifle, and .ifge con-
         ditional assembly directives.  

     5.  Added  support  for the Tandy Color Computer Disc Basic
         binary file format to ASLINK.  

     6.  Updated the assembler and linker source code to support
         16-Bit and 32-Bit compilers.  Tested with Borland Turbo
         C++  3.0  and  Symantec 7.2 C/C++ 16-Bit compilers, and
         with Visual C++ 6.0, Cygwin, DJGPP  V02.03,  and  Linux
         32-Bit compilers.  

     7.  Problem:  
         When  an area size is equal to the 'address space size'
         the size parameter is reported as 0.  (A normal  condi-
         tion  caused  by  address rollover to 0.) Aslink inter-
         preted this as a 0 size.  

         Fix:  
         A  new area 'Output Code Flag' bit was defined to indi-
         cate when data is  defined  in  an  area.   ASxxxx  and
         Aslink  have  been updated to set and process this area
         flag bit.  

     8.  Problem:  
         The  use  of  the .end assembler directive in an Asxxxx
         assembler would cause Aslink  to  output  the  optional
         start address in all output files.  

         Fix:  
         Updated  Aslink  to  output  the optional start address
         only in the output file associated with  the  area/bank
         containing the .end directive.  

     9.  Problem:  
         Aslink  creates  output  files for banks with no output
         data.  

         Fix:  
         Aslink  now  deletes  any created output file for banks
         with no data.  

    10.  Incorporated  the  patches  contained in p01400.zip for
         files t1802.asm and 1802pst.c to correct for  an  error
         in  the  opcodes  generated  for  the  BM,  BL, and BNF
         mnemonics.  

    11.  Incorporated  the  patches  contained in p02400.zip for
         file ds8adr.c to correct for an  error  in  the  direct
         page addressing mode of AS8xCxxx.  

    12.  Incorporated  the  patches  contained in p03400.zip for
         file rabmch.c to correct for an error in the processing
         of the "ret cc" instruction.  

    13.  Made many corrections to internal code comments.
