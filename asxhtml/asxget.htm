is no potentially dangerous code  (or  accidental  virus  infec-

version  of the software, and I bear no responsibility for what-
ever damages, direct or consequential, you may suffer  from  its
use.   I definitely do not warrant this software for suitability
for any particular purpose, either.  It is  also  possible  that
the instructions, the extra utilities, or the examples that come
with the software contain errors,  none  of  which  were  inten-
tional.
